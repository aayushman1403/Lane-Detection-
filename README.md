# Lane-Detection-
Lane coloration has become popular in real time vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). The main emphasis of this paper is to find the further ways which can be used further to improve the result of lane detection algorithms. Noise, visibility etc. can reduce the performance or the existing lane detection algorithms.
